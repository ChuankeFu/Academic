The loin muscle depth is a quantitative trait that is influenced by whole-genome distributed polygenes. To identify the possible candidate genes and mutations impacting the LMD, we used genome-wide association study (GWAS), which is commonly used to identify candidate genomic regions associated with complex growth traits, to mapping the genomic regions. As over 90% of the identified variants have been localized to non-coding regions of the pig genome and their functions in phenotype regulation are poorly understood, we further combined 3D epigenomics to understand the mechanism of genetic variants regulating LMD. In combination with different types of data and analyses, we identified a 10 kb quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 17 that was significantly associated with LMD. We identified the BMP2 gene as a major candidate gene, and SNP rs1111440035 and rs321846600 were identified as likely candidate mutations affecting the LMD. Our study is unique in its attempt to identify candidate genetic variants by integrating GWAS and 3D epigenomics in pigs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Integrated analysis of genome-wide association studies and 3D epigenomic characteristics reveal the BMP2 gene regulating loin muscle depth in Yorkshire pigs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"JUMP is a Julia Package (binary version) for genomic selection(prediction) with BLUP and Bayesian methods!

For genetic evaluations including crossbreds, several methods based on single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) have been proposed, including metafounder ssGBLUP (MF-ssGBLUP) and breed-specific ssGBLUP (BS-ssGBLUP). Ideally, models that account for breed effects should perform better than simple models, but knowledge on the performance of these methods is lacking for two-way crossbred cattle. In addition, the differences in the estimates of genetic parameters (such as the genetic variance component and heritability) between these methods have rarely been investigated. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) compare the estimates of genetic parameters for average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between these methods; and (2) evaluate the impact of these methods on the predictive ability for crossbred performance.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Genomic evaluation for two-way crossbred performance in cattle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quanshun Mei(author)","Zulma G Vitezica","Jielin Li","Shuhong Zhao","Andres Legarra","Tao Xiang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"ef15e94dcb86505cd69cf41f6ada674f","permalink":"/zh/publication/2022.gse/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/2022.gse/","section":"publication","summary":"At the beginning of genomic selection, some Chinese companies genotyped pigs with different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays.

However, dominance effects that may be important for some traits can be fitted in a mixed linear model as either ‘classical’ or ‘genotypic’ dominance effects. Their influence on genomic evaluation has rarely been studied. Thus, the objectives of this study were to use a dataset from Canadian Yorkshire pigs to (1) compare different strategies to combine data from two SNP arrays (Affymetrix 55K and Illumina 42K) and identify the most appropriate strategy for genomic evaluation and (2) evaluate the impact of dominance effects (classical’ and ‘genotypic’) and inbreeding depression effects on genomic predictive abilities for average daily gain (ADG), backfat thickness (BF), loin muscle depth (LMD), days to 100 kg (AGE100), and the total number of piglets born (TNB) at first parity.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Impacts of additive, dominance, and inbreeding depression effects on genomic evaluation by combining two SNP chips in Canadian Yorkshire pigs bred in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fang Fang","Jielin Li","Meng Guo","Quanshun Mei(author)","Mei Yu","Huiming Liu","Andres Legarra","Tao Xiang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1658016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1658016000,"objectID":"d245d9ed575c7b3050786b259de135ad","permalink":"/zh/publication/2022.jas_co_author/","publishdate":"2022-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/2022.jas_co_author/","section":"publication","summary":"Joint genomic evaluation by combining data recordings and genomic information from different pig herds and populations is of interest for pig breeding companies because the efficiency of genomic selection (GS) could be further improved. In this work, an efficient strategy of joint genomic evaluation combining data from multiple pig populations is investigated. Total teat number (TTN), a trait that is equally recorded on 13,060 American Yorkshire (AY) populations (~14.68 teats) and 10,060 Danish Yorkshire (DY) pigs (~14.29 teats), was used to explore the feasibility and accuracy of GS combining datasets from different populations. We first estimated the genetic correlation (rg) of TTN between AY and DY pig populations (⁠rg = 0.79, se = 0.23). Then we employed the genome-wide association study to identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions that are significantly associated with TTN and investigate the genetic architecture of TTN in different populations. Our results suggested that the genomic regions controlling TTN are slightly different in the two Yorkshire populations, where the candidate QTL regions were on SSC 7 and SSC 8 for the AY population and on SSC 7 for the DY population. Finally, we explored an optimal way of genomic prediction for TTN via three different genomic best linear unbiased prediction models and we concluded that when TTN across populations are regarded as different, but correlated, traits in a multitrait model, predictive abilities for both Yorkshire populations improve. As a conclusion, joint genomic evaluation for target traits in multiple pig populations is feasible in practice and more accurate, provided a proper model is used.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Genomic evaluation and genome-wide association studies for total number of teats in a combined American and Danish Yorkshire pig populations selected in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Using C++ to re-write R package-blupADC to improve the speed and memory performance!\n","date":1651017600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1651017600,"objectID":"85a95d198c6cb87ea3d03db429ad58c8","permalink":"/zh/project/blupadc_c++/blupadc_c++/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/project/blupadc_c++/blupadc_c++/","section":"project","summary":"C++ version of blupADC.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"blupADC-C++","type":"project"},{"authors":["Quanshun Mei(author)","Chuanke Fu","Jielin Li","Shuhong Zhao","Tao Xiang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1631836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1631836800,"objectID":"2078c56d6505484948920455caea5f98","permalink":"/zh/publication/2022.blupadc/","publishdate":"2021-09-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/2022.blupadc/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic analysis is a systematic and complex procedure in animal and plant breeding.

To make the whole genetic analysis in animal and plant breeding straightforward, we developed a powerful, robust and fast R package that includes genomic data format conversion, genomic data quality control and genotype imputation, breed composition analysis, pedigree tracing, analysis and visualization, pedigree-based and genomic-based relationship matrix construction, and genomic evaluation. In addition, to simplify the application of this package, we also developed a shiny toolkit for users.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"blupADC - An R package and shiny toolkit for comprehensive genetic data analysis in animal and plant breeding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quanshun Mei(author)","Chuanke Fu","Goutam Sahana","Yilong Chen","Lilin Yin","Yuanxin Miao","Shuhong Zhao","Tao Xiang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r\r","date":1626480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1626480000,"objectID":"f86d34600453217bd987b888aaa55264","permalink":"/zh/publication/2021.jas/","publishdate":"2021-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/2021.jas/","section":"publication","summary":"Semen traits are crucial in commercial pig production since semen from boars is widely used in artificial insemination for both purebred and crossbred pig production. Revealing the genetic architecture of semen traits potentially promotes the efficiencies of improving semen traits through artificial selection. This study is aimed to identify candidate genes related to the semen traits in Duroc boars. First, we identified the genes that were significantly associated with three semen traits, including sperm motility (MO), sperm concentration (CON), and semen volume (VOL) in a Duroc boar population through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Second, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 2, 3, and 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with MO, CON, and VOL, respectively. Based on the haplotype block analysis, we identified one genetic region associated with MO, which explained 6.15% of the genetic trait variance. ENSSSCG00000018823 located within this region was considered as the candidate gene for regulating MO. Another genetic region explaining 1.95% of CON genetic variance was identified, and, in this region, B9D2, PAFAH1B3, TMEM145, and CIC were detected as the CON-related candidate genes. Two genetic regions that accounted for 2.23% and 2.48% of VOL genetic variance were identified, and, in these two regions, WWC2, CDKN2AIP, ING2, TRAPPC11, STOX2, and PELO were identified as VOL-related candidate genes. WGCNA analysis showed that, among these candidate genes, B9D2, TMEM145, WWC2, CDKN2AIP, TRAPPC11, and PELO were located within the most significant module eigengenes, confirming these candidate genes’ role in regulating semen traits in Duroc boars. The identification of these candidate genes can help to better understand the genetic architecture of semen traits in boars. Our findings can be applied for semen traits improvement in Duroc boars.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Identification of new semen trait-related candidate genes in Duroc boars through genome-wide association and weighted gene co-expression network analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Linear mixed Models Toolbox (lmt) is a stand-alone single executable software for for large scale linear mixed model analysis. lmt has been used successfully for genetic evaluation data sets with \u0026raquo;200k genotyped animals, \u0026raquo;15m animals, \u0026raquo;500m equations.\nIn order to further assistance the use of lmt, I developed an R package: Rlmt for interfacing with lmt.

这个package了，那么为什么还要开发blupADC-online 呢？\n其实，blupADC-online可以看成是blupADC package的简化版。凡是blupADC-online 能实现的功能， blupADCpackage均能实现。但是，考虑到部分用户可能对R不太了解，因此我们想到了开发blupADC-online 。通过blupADC-online ，用户即使没有编程基础也能很快的完成相应的分析💯。\n本节，我们给大家带来的是如何通过blupADC-online 完成DMU相关的分析。\n✋登录\r在浏览器栏直接输入网址: http://47.95.251.15:443/sample-apps/blupADC/ 即可登录到blupADC-online主界面，如下所示：\n首先我们在菜单栏点击DMU图标，即可发现有三个子菜单，从上到下依次是：\nDIR、SOL 和 Run DMU。本节的重点就是介绍这三个子菜单界面。\n如果大家事先已经了解过run_DMU 函数的话，那么本节内容可能对大家来说就比较熟悉了。如果没有事先了解也没关系，因为相关的操作还是非常简单的。\n\r✋DIR界面\r点击DIR菜单，我们就能进入 DIR界面。DIR界面的主要功能是生成 DMU格式的参数文件。下面我们来对界面内的各个参数进行逐一讲解：\nBasic information\r\rNumber of trait: 要分析的性状的数目\rNumber of integer variable: 表型数据中，整型变量的个数\rName of genetic effect: 遗传效应的名称(一般为动植物个体Id)\rUpload colnames of phenotype data: 上传表型数据的列名文件。文件格式如下所示：\r\rNote: 列名文件的格式为：n行1列。每行代表的是表型数据的列名。\n\rFile path and name\r\rRelationship file path: 亲缘关系文件的路径\n\rRelationship file name: 亲缘关系文件的名称。\n针对不同的Analysis model，我们需要提供不同的亲缘关系文件。具体对应关系为：\n\rPBLUP_A: 亲缘关系文件为系谱文件\rGBLUP_A: 亲缘关系文件为基因组亲缘关系矩阵的逆矩阵文件\rGBLUP_AD: 亲缘关系文件为基因组亲缘关系矩阵的逆矩阵文件\rSSBLUP_A: 亲缘关系文件为系谱文件及基因组亲缘关系矩阵文件\r\rPhenotype file path: 表型文件的路径\n\rPhenotype file name: 表型文件的名称\n\r\r\rDMU parameter\r\rDMU module: DMU进行遗传评估时所选用的模块，默认为 dmuai 。\n\rDMU algorithm code: 方差组分估计所用的算法，默认为 1。\n\rAnalysis model: 进行遗传评估所选用的模型。可选模型包括：\n\rPBLUP_A: 系谱加性效应模型\rGBLUP_A: 基因组加性效应模型\rGBLUP_AD:基因组加性-显性效应模型\rSSBLUP_A:一步法加性效应模型\r\r\r当用户上传表型数据的列名文件后，当前界面内便会新增几个窗口，如下：\n用户可以通过设置Number of trait来调整小窗口的个数。\ne.g. 当设置Number of trait为3时，就会生成3个小窗口，如下所示：\n用户可以在窗口内输入想要分析的性状名称及对应的固定效应、随机效应和协变量效应的名称。为了方便用户输入，选择性状和效应名称时可通过下拉菜单选取，如下：\n下面以一个具体的例子进行说明：\ne.g. 想要分析的性状为：ADG ;\n固定效应包括： Sex 和 Breed;\n随机效应包括Id ;\n协变量效应包括：Age_at_off_test。\n那么我们只需要在窗口内输入对应的信息即可，如下：\n输入完相应的效应后，在界面的正下方会实时显示所生成的 dir 参数文件内容，如下所示：\n用户可以通过下方的 Download DIR按键即可将生成的 dir 文件下载到本地。\n\r\r✋SOL界面\r点击左侧的SOL子菜单，我们就能进入SOL界面。\nSOL界面的主要功能是整理DMU输出的结果，快速得到EBV、残差、校正表型和DEBV等结果。下面我们来对界面内的各个参数进行逐一讲解：\n\rNumber of trait: 要分析的性状的数目\rGenetic number in SOL file: SOL文件中，遗传效应所对应的数字代码\rName of genetic effect: 遗传效应的名称(一般为动植物个体Id)\r\rPhenotype\r\rUpload colnames of phenotype data: 上传表型数据的列名文件。\rUpload phenotype data: 上传表型数据文件\r\r\rDEBV(可选:当需要计算DEBV时，才需要上传相应的文件。)\r\rUpload pedigree file: 上传系谱数据文件\rUpload subset id: 上传需要计算DEBV的个体号数据文件\r\r\rDMU result\r\rUpload SOL file: 上传DMU输出的SOL文件\rUpload RESIDUAL file: 上传DMU输出的RESIDUAL文件\rUpload PAROUT file: 上传DMU输出的PAROUT 文件\r\r和之前的类似，当我们上传了表型数据的列名文件后，当前界面内同样会新增几个窗口，如下：\n当我们输入了对应的性状名称后，界面正下方就会以表格的形式 实时显示 个体对应的EBV, 残差，校正表型和 DEBV，如下：\n用户可以在表格内轻松的完成查询、排序等操作。\n用户可以通过下方的 Download corrected phe按键即可将校正表型文件下载到本地。\n\r\r✋Run dmu界面\r点击左侧的Run DMU子菜单，我们就能进入Run DMU 界面。\nRun DMU界面的主要功能是快速帮我们完成DMU相关的分析。其实，Run DMU界面的功能可以看成是 DIR界面和 SOL界面功能的集合体。不过，二者最重要的区别是，Run DMU界面能自动帮我们调用DMU软件并完成相应的分析。\n总结起来就是：通过Run DMU 界面，我们只需要提供相关的性状名称和表型、系谱等数据文件后，就能得到最终的个体育种值、残差、校正表型和DEBV等结果。\nRun DMU 界面内的各个参数在 DIR界面和SOL界面内都有详细讲解，这里就不再赘述了。\n完成了前期的数据准备工作后，用户只需要点击 Run DMU 按键，就能开始DMU的分析了。\n由于不同数据量的分析时间是不同的，因此需要耐心的等待。通常情况下，几分钟就能得到结果。结果如下所示：\n用户通过点击下方的 Download EBV按键即可将生成的文件保存到本地。\n\r","date":1619049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1619104301,"objectID":"1c2e38a35338970012171a927ee72425","permalink":"/zh/post/feature-9-shiny_blupadc/online_dmu/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/zh/post/feature-9-shiny_blupadc/online_dmu/","section":"post","summary":"blupADC-online

🤠在讲述完各种各样的数据预处理方法后，我们正式进入到育种数据的分析层面。在目前的动植物育种领域，主要的育种软件包括但不限于以下两种：DMU和BLUPf90。这两款软件均是于上世纪80-90年代开发的，并且一直处于维护中。截至目前，两款软件的引用次数均已接近千次(实际可能更多), 这也足见这两款软件的认可度。\n但是，这两款软件均存在一个共同的缺点，就是使用起来较为麻烦(需要提供准备好的参数文件)。笔者当时学习参数文件的配置时，前前后后花费了近一个月的时间，足以见这两款软件的不友好性🥶。\n为此，我们在R中编写了相应的函数，使得用户可以轻松的完成两款软件参数文件的配置及对应的数据分析。本章我们主要讲述如何通过BLUP_ADC中的run_DMU函数，在R中调用DMU软件并完成数据分析。在下一章，我们将会讲述如何在R中调用BLUPf90软件，并完成数相应的据分析。\n👉

🤖通常来讲，我们公司拿到的原始芯片数据大都是包含缺失值且未经过质控的。而在实际的数据分析中，我们一般都要求数据是经过质控和填充。为此，blupADC中提供了geno_qc_impute函数，可以方便我们在R中调用Plink(用于质控)和Beagle(用于填充)软件进行基因型数据的质控和填充。\n👉 Note: 为了方便用户使用, blupADC 已经事先封装好了 Plink(用于质控) version-1.9 和 Beagle(用于填充) version-5.2 软件，用户无需再重新下载. 如果用户想自行指定软件的版本，可以通过更改相关的参数(在进阶参数部分里).\n老规矩，我们还是用一个小例子来看下函数的用法:\n示例 library(blupADC)\rgeno_qc_impute(\rinput_data_hmp=example_data_hmp, #provided hapmap data object\rdata_analysis_method=\u0026quot;QC_Imputation\u0026quot;, #analysis method type,QC + imputatoin\routput_data_path=getwd(), #output data path\routput_data_name=\u0026quot;YY_data\u0026quot;, #output data name\routput_data_type=\u0026quot;VCF\u0026quot; #output data format )  通过上述代码，我们即可对本地的Hapmap格式的基因型数据进行质控和填充，并将其以VCF格式并保存到本地。\n进行质控和填充时，我们必须要事先提供基因型数据，这部分的参数与geno_format函数中的参数用法一致。具体大家可参阅之前的介绍: 基因型数据间的格式转换。\n完成了基因型数据的提供后，我们可以通过以下参数进行质控填充的相关分析。\n参数详解 💙基础参数   参数1：data_analysis_method\n指定基因型数据的处理方法，character类型。可选方法包括：\n  \u0026ldquo;QC\u0026rdquo; :进行质控\n  \u0026ldquo;Imputation\u0026rdquo; :进行填充\n  \u0026ldquo;QC_Imputation\u0026rdquo; :先质控，后填充\n    参数2：qc_snp_rate\n  使用Plink进行质控时，SNP call rate 的阈值，numeric类型，默认为0.1。\n 参数3：qc_ind_rate  使用Plink进行质控时，IND call rate 的阈值，numeric类型，默认为0.1。\n 参数4：qc_maf  使用Plink进行质控时，MAF 的阈值，numeric类型，默认为0.05。\n

The data of age at 100 kg, backfat thickness at 100 kg and teat numbers were collected from 2 585 Yorkshire sows and all the individuals were genotyped by using PorcineSNP50K Beadchip. The accuracy of genomic selection for the 8 models were compared by a 5-fold cross-validation procedure based on additive model. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of genomic selection were positively correlated with the calculated heritabilities of different traits. The cross-validation analysis indicated that the prediction accuracy of age at 100 kg was the highest among the 3 different traits, but different models performed dissimilarly in different traits. The prediction accuracy of SSGBLUP was the highest for both age at 100 kg and backfat thickness at 100 kg, and the prediction accuracy of BayesA was the highest for teat numbers. In conclusion, SSGBLUP model can be used for the traits with moderate and high heritabilities when conducting genomic prediction for small sample size and BayesA is suitable to the traits with low heritability. How to optimize and select a model that is applicable to all traits may be a research direction in the future.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A study of genome selection based on the porcine major economic traits","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
