## blupADC- New features in genomis selection

ðŸ¤  In the previous version of blupADC, we have given a comprehensive description of perform BLUP analysis in genomic selection. In order to further simplify the usage of blupADC, we have incorporated R6 package, which supports oriented programming. In the below, we will give server examples of how to perform single trait and multiple traits analysis of PBLUP, GBLUP and ssGBLUP. Also, user can perform cross validation in an easy way in the latest version of blupADC. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:**  **For the latest version of blupADC, user has to install package `blupSUP` at first, in which example data and software (e.g. DMU and BLUPF90)  are included in this package  **. 

## Example

### Single-trait BLUP model
```{r include=FALSE}

library(blupADC)
```
```{r include=TRUE}
library(blupSUP)
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupSUP")
#prepare parameters the BLUP analysis
blup_par=BLUPpar$new(
phe_file=paste0(data_path,"/phenotype.txt"),                                            
phe_colnames=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2","Age"),
dmu_integer_n=5, #number of integer variable in the phenotype file (required by DMU)
analysis_model="PBLUP_A",
kinship_file=paste0(data_path,"/pedigree.txt"))
#define the model effect  of Trait1
myblup=BLUP$new(fixed=Trait1~Sex+Herd_Year_Season, #fixed effect
                random=~Id+Litter, #random effect 
                pars=blup_par) #blup_par has been defined previously
myblup
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#BLUP analysis of Trait1
myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="DMU") # default using DMU 
#myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="BLUPF90") #using BLUPF90 for analysis 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#BLUP analysis of Trait1
myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="DMU") # default using DMU 
#myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="BLUPF90") #using BLUPF90 for analysis 
```

```{r message=FALSE}
#output of BLUP analysis
ebv=myblup$ebv         #breeding value
h2=myblup$h2   #heritability and its SE
user_defined_h2=myblup$cal_se(~Id1/(Id1+Litter1+Res1)) #user defined expression of calculating h2 based on delta method
```
```{r include=TRUE}
head(ebv)
h2
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
#GBLUP-A analysis 
myblup$pars$kinship_file=paste0(data_path,"/G_Ainv_col_three.txt")
myblup$pars$analysis_model="GBLUP_A"
myblup$run(task_type="DMU")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#ssGBLUP-A analysis 
myblup$pars$kinship_file=paste0(data_path,"/",c("pedigree.txt","G_A_col_three.txt"))
myblup$pars$analysis_model="SSBLUP_A"
myblup$run(task_type="DMU")
```

### Multiple traits BLUP  model

``` R
library(blupSUP)
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupSUP")
#prepare parameters the BLUP analysis
blup_par=BLUPpar$new(
phe_file=paste0(data_path,"/phenotype.txt"),                                               phe_colnames=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2","Age"),
dmu_integer_n=5, #number of integer variable in the phenotype file (required by DMU)
analysis_model="PBLUP_A",
kinship_file=paste0(data_path,"/pedigree.txt"))

#define the effect of Trait1 for BLUP analysis
myblup=BLUP$new(fixed=Trait1~Sex+Herd_Year_Season, #fixed effect
               random=~Id+Litter, #random effect 
               pars=blup_par) #blup_par has been defined previously
myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="DMU") # default using DMU 
myblup
```
``` {r include=FALSE}
library(blupSUP)
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupSUP")
#prepare parameters the BLUP analysis
blup_par=BLUPpar$new(
phe_file=paste0(data_path,"/phenotype.txt"),                                               phe_colnames=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2","Age"),
dmu_integer_n=5, #number of integer variable in the phenotype file (required by DMU)
analysis_model="PBLUP_A",
kinship_file=paste0(data_path,"/pedigree.txt"))

#define the effect of Trait1 for BLUP analysis
myblup=BLUP$new(fixed=Trait1~Sex+Herd_Year_Season, #fixed effect
               random=~Id+Litter, #random effect 
               pars=blup_par) #blup_par has been defined previously
myblup$run(output_path="D:/test",task_type="DMU") # default using DMU 
```

``` {r include=TRUE}
myblup
#Multiple traits analysis
#add model effect of Trait2 in BLUP analysis
myblup$add_model(fixed=Trait2~Herd_Year_Season,random=~Id,covariate=~Age)
myblup
```
``` R
myblup$run() #Multiple traits analysis                 

#remove Trait2 in BLUP analysis 
#myblup$rm_model("Trait2") 

#output of BLUP analysis
ebv=myblup$ebv         #breeding value
h2=myblup$h2   #heritability and its SE
genR2=myblup$r2 #genetic correlation and its SE 
user_defined_h2=myblup$cal_se(~Id1/(Id1+Litter1+Res1)) #user defined expression of calculating h2 based on delta method
user_defined_genR2=myblup$cal_se(~Id1_2/sqrt(Id1 * Id2)) #user defined expression of calculating genR2 based on delta method
#random effect names from multiple traits model were defined in: rownames(myblup$vars_se$vars_mat)         
```
