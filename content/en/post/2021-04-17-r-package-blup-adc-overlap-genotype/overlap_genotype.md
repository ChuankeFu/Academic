## Overview 

ðŸ‘¦  Duplicated genotype is usually a problem in data analysis. In package:`blupADC`, user can detect the overlap genotype data  by applying `genotype_data_overlap` function.

## Example

``` {.R}
library(blupADC)
overlap_result=genotype_data_overlap(
                  input_data_hmp=data_hmp,   #provided hapmap data object
                  overlap_threshold=0.95,    # threshold of duplicate 
                  return_result=TRUE         #return result 
                  )
```

## Parameter 

Many parameters in  `genotype_data_overlap` are the as `genotype_data_format_conversion` function(see details). 

Thus, we will introduce  specific parameters in  `genotype_data_overlap`  function.

-   **1ï¼šselected_snps** 

Number of SNPs in detecting overlap,`numeric` calss. Default is 1000.

-   **2ï¼šoverlap_threshold**

Threshold of duplicate genotype, `numeric` class. Default is 0.95.

When the proportion of genotype data between two individuals is larger than this threshold, these two individuals will be regarded as the same individual.
