## Overview

ðŸ¤  In the previous section, we have given detailed description about data preparation.  In the following section, we will introduce genetic evaluation software in animal and plant breeding.  Nowadays, in the filed of animal and plant breeding,  two of the most famous breeding software are **DMU** and **BLUPF90** ( cited over than one thousand).  

Although these two softwares have many advantages, these two softwares have one common pitfall: it is a little difficult to use for freshman(need to prepare parameter file). Thus, in order to overcome this pitfall,  package `blupADC`  provides  `run_DMU` and `run_BLUPF90` for interfacing **DMU** and **BLUPF90** in an easy way.  

In this section, we will give detail description about `run_DMU` function. 

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:**  **Package `blupADC` has encapsulated  the basic module of DMU(`dmu1`,`dmuai`, and `dmu5`) , more modules could be download from website**([DMU download website](https://dmu.ghpc.au.dk/dmu/)). 

 **For commercial use of DMU,  user must contact the author of DMU !!!** 

## Example

### Single trait  - pedigree BLUP model

``` R
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupADC")  #  path of provided files 
  
run_DMU(
        phe_col_names=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2","Age"), # colnames of phenotype
        target_trait_name=list(c("Trait1")),                           #trait name 
        fixed_effect_name=list(c("Sex","Herd_Year_Season")),     #fixed effect name
        random_effect_name=list(c("Id","Litter")),               #random effect name
        covariate_effect_name=NULL,                              #covariate effect name
        genetic_effect_name="Id",	                 #genetic effect name 
        phe_path=data_path,                          #path of phenotype file
        phe_name="phenotype.txt",                    #name of phenotype file
        integer_n=5,                                 #number of integer variable 
        analysis_model="PBLUP_A",                    #model of genetic evaluation
        dmu_module="dmuai",                          #modeule of estimating variance components

        relationship_name="pedigree.txt",            #name of relationship file 
        output_result_path=getwd()                    # output path 
        )
```

### Single trait  - GBLUP  model

``` R
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupADC")  #  path of provided files 
run_DMU(
        phe_col_names=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2","Age"), # colnames of phenotype 
        target_trait_name=list(c("Trait1")),                           #trait name 
        fixed_effect_name=list(c("Sex","Herd_Year_Season")),     #fixed effect name
        random_effect_name=list(c("Id","Litter")),               #random effect name
        covariate_effect_name=NULL,                              #covariate effect name
        genetic_effect_name="Id",	                 #genetic effect name
        phe_path=data_path,                          #path of phenotype file
        phe_name="phenotype.txt",                    #name of phenotype file
        integer_n=5,                                 #number of integer variable 
        analysis_model="GBLUP_A",                    #model of genetic evaluation
        dmu_module="dmuai",                          #modeule of estimating variance components 
        relationship_path=data_path,                 #path of relationship file 
        relationship_name="G_Ainv_col_three.txt",            #name of relationship file 
        output_result_path=getwd()                    # output path 
        )
```

### Single trait  - single-step BLUP model

``` R
library(blupADC)
data_path=system.file("extdata", package = "blupADC")  #  path of provided files 
run_DMU(
        phe_col_names=c("Id","Mean","Sex","Herd_Year_Season","Litter","Trait1","Trait2"), # colnames of phenotype 
        target_trait_name=list(c("Trait1")),                           #trait name 
        fixed_effect_name=list(c("Sex","Herd_Year_Season")),     #fixed effect name
        random_effect_name=list(c("Id","Litter")),               #random effect name
        covariate_effect_name=NULL,                              #covariate effect name
        genetic_effect_name="Id",	                 #genetic effect name
        phe_path=data_path,                          #path of phenotype file
        phe_name="phenotype.txt",                    #name of phenotype file
        integer_n=5,                                 #number of integer variable 
        analysis_model="SSBLUP_A",                    #model of genetic evaluation
        dmu_module="dmuai",                          #modeule of estimating variance components 
        relationship_path=data_path,                 #path of relationship file 
        relationship_name=c("pedigree.txt","G_A_col_three.txt"),            #name of relationship file 
        output_result_path=getwd()                    # output path 
        )
```

Through modifying the two parameters: `analysis_model` and `relationship_name` , we can perform Pedigree-BLUP, GBLUP, and SSBLUP analysis (PS: we can get G_Ainv_col_three.txt  and G_A\_col_three.txt   by `cal_kinship` functionï¼Œ[see more details](https://qsmei.netlify.app/post/2021-04-17-r-package-blup-adc-calculate-relationship-matrix/relationship_matrix/)  about `cal_kinship` function). 

The above example is single-trait model, while in actual breeding, multiple traits model is also common.  Similarly, we only need to modify several parameters to  perform multiple traits model: 

### Multiple traits  - pedigree BLUP model

        target_trait_name=list(c("Trait1"),c("Trait2")),                           #trait name 
        fixed_effect_name=list(c("Sex","Herd_Year_Season"),c("Herd_Year_Season")),     #fixed effect name
        random_effect_name=list(c("Id","Litter"),c("Id")),               #random effect name
        covariate_effect_name=list(NULL,"Age"),                              #covariate effect name
        genetic_effect_name="Id",	                 #genetic effect name
        phe_path=data_path,                          #path of phenotype file
        phe_name="phenotype.txt",                    #name of phenotype file
        integer_n=5,                                 #number of integer variable 
        analysis_model="PBLUP_A",                    #model of genetic evaluation

        relationship_path=data_path,                 #path of relationship file 
        relationship_name="pedigree.txt",            #name of relationship file

-   **25ï¼šprovided_effect_file_path**  

File path of trait's  model effect data,   `character` class. 

File of trait's model effect include fixed effects name, random effects name, and covariate effects name.  Once user provides this file,  user don't need to set  these three parameters: `fixed_effect_name `  `random_effect_name `  `covariate_effect_name `. 

The format of this effect file is as following:

| V1     | V2   | V3   | V4               | V5   | V6   | V7     | V8   | V9   |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Trait1 | \*   | Sex  | Herd_Year_Season | \*   | Id   | Litter | \*   | \*   |
| Trait2 | \*   | Sex  | \*               | Id   | \*   | Age    | \*   |      |

The first column is the name of target trait.  Each column stands for one effect name.  In order to recognize three types of effect, we  set  \*   to distinguish each type.   

Effects name between the first   \*  and the second  \*  stand for fixed effects name;   

effects name between the second   \*  and the third  \*  stand for random effects name; 

 effects name between the third   \*  and the fourth  \*  stand for covariate effects name.
