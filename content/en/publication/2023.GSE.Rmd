abstract: Dairy cattle production systems are mostly based on purebreds, but recently the use of crossbreeding has received increased interest. For genetic evaluations including crossbreds, several methods based on single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) have been proposed, including metafounder ssGBLUP (MF-ssGBLUP) and breed-specific ssGBLUP (BS-ssGBLUP). Ideally, models that account for breed effects should perform better than simple models, but knowledge on the performance of these methods is lacking for two-way crossbred cattle. In addition, the differences in the estimates of genetic parameters (such as the genetic variance component and heritability) between these methods have rarely been investigated. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) compare the estimates of genetic parameters for average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between these methods; and (2) evaluate the impact of these methods on the predictive ability for crossbred performance.
