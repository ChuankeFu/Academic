abstract: The feed conversion ratio (FCR) is an important productive trait that greatly affects profits in the pig industry. Elucidating the genetic mechanisms underpinning FCR may promote more efficient improvement of FCR through artificial selection. In this study, we integrated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with transcriptome analyses of different tissues in Yorkshire pigs (YY) with the aim of identifying key genes and signalling pathways associated with FCR.
