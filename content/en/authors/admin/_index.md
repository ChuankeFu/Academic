I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Department of [Biostatistics](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/ ) at [Boston University School of Public Health](https://www.bu.edu/sph/about/departments/biostatistics/).  My research interests include applying multi-omics data in genomic prediction and the development of new software. 

I am always eager to learn and try new things!
