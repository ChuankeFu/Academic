I am a PhD student in Quantitative Genetics of Animal Breeding at Huazhong Agricultural University. My research interests include applying genomic selection and machine learning in animal breeding. I enjoy developing new software to facilitate complicated analysis using different programming languages, such as R(Rcpp), Julia, C++ and etc.  

I am always eager to learn and try new things!
