The Linear mixed Models Toolbox (lmt) is a stand-alone single executable software for for large scale linear mixed model analysis. lmt has been used successfully for genetic evaluation data sets with >>200k genotyped animals, >>15m animals, >>500m equations. 

 In order to further assistance the use of lmt, I developed an R package: Rlmt for interfacing with lmt. This R package is developed via R6 package which can provides an implementation of encapsulated object-oriented programming for R. And this makes the grammar of Rlmt looks like easy and elegant (i hope ðŸ˜„).
